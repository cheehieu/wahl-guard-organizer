The [Wahl Lithium-Ion Cordless Haircutting Kit](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0799FGHCK) comes with 24 pieces including the clipper, clipper charging cord, clipper blade cover, 12 attachment guards with convenient storage bag, two hair combs, scissors with blade cover, blade detail cleaning brush, blade oil, blade cleaning cloth, and convenient storage case with handle. I appreciate the value, but all of these pieces can be a lot to keep track of... especially when just throwing everything into the storage bag/case.

To improve portability when traveling, I wanted to create a simple organizer to carry the essentials. There are some existing solutions, but most seem to be meant for display purposes or mounting for easy access. Here are some examples:
